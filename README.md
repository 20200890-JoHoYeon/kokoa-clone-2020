## Development Story :question:

During the course of the lecture, I created the project through clone coding, and there were some interesting and difficult parts in the process. :+1:

And I did this process well without any problems. <br />
Looking back at this lecture, finding errors in programming or adding my own special features really worked, and I learned a lot from it. :+1:
